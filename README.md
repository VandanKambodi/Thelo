## Overall Core Flow

- User Access: User visits the homepage, presented with login/signup options.

- Authentication: Users sign up (selecting "Seller" or "Shopkeeper") or log in, handled by secure backend APIs.

- Role-Based Redirection: Authenticated users are redirected to their respective dashboards.

- Profile Creation (if new): Upon first login, users are prompted to create their role-specific profile (e.g., Seller's brand details).

- Seller Workflow:

    - Sellers add new products with details and images (converted to Base64 and stored in DB).

    - Their dashboard immediately updates, displaying their product list.

    - Sellers can edit or delete their listed products.

- Shopkeeper Workflow:

    - Shopkeepers browse a marketplace of all active products.

    - Search and filter products by name or location.

    - Clicking a product loads its full details (including image) on demand for fast Browse.

    - Shopkeepers can add products to their shopping cart.

- Checkout: Items from the cart proceed to a checkout page where the order is confirmed and placed (Cash on Delivery).

- Secure Interactions: All data flow between frontend, backend, and database is secured using JWTs and hashed passwords.
